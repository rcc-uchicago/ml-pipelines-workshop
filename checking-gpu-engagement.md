# GPU Enagement
Here are a few quick tips on how to make sure you're actually using a GPU.

## Checking in terminal

 Before you even run your script, it can be useful to check to ensure 

 NVIDIA has a built in System Management Interface that makes this simple with one command:
```
 nvidia-smi
 ```

You should see details about the device, if it is detected.




## Tensorflow
Here's how to check if tensorflow sees your GPU/s.
```
import tensorflow as tf
```
The one-liner:
```
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```
For more info:
```
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
tf.config.experimental.get_device_details(gpus[0])
```

## PyTorch
And here's how to check with PyTorch
```
import torch
torch.cuda.device_count()
torch.cuda.get_device_name()
```
